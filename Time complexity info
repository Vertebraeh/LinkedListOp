StackImplementation Time complexity

       The time complexity of the code snippet is O(1) for all the operations - push, pop, and top.

This is because the implementation of the Stack class is based on a LinkedList data structure, which provides constant time complexity for adding and removing elements from the beginning of the list (i.e., addFirst() and removeFirst() methods).

As a result, regardless of the size of the stack, the time taken to perform these operations remains constant. Therefore, the time complexity of this code snippet is O(1).       










QUeueImplementation Time Complexity

           The time complexity of enqueue() and dequeue() methods in the Queue class is O(1), which means they take constant time to execute regardless of the size of the queue.

The time complexity of the main() method is O(1) because it only calls enqueue(), dequeue(), and print statements a fixed number of times. Thus, the overall time complexity of the given code is O(1).
